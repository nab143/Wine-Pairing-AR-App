# Wine Pairing AR App

## TEAM: Carolina Diaz & Nicole Barba

## APP DESCRIPTION: 
## Using Unity (a game development platform) to create the app, this AR App will help users discover wine pairings. The user will first enter the type of wine preferred into a search menu. In AR mode, the user will point the camera on a plate with an image target and a 3D model of the food pairing will appear. The app will also display information about the wine, food pairing, and wine rating (according to http://www.winespectator.com). The target users for this app are wine lovers and “foodies”. 

## FEATURES: 
## - A search bar for different kinds of wines.
## - One image target for placement of the 3D virtual food pairing.
## - Pulling information from a spreadsheet (that we create based off of information found on winespectator.com).
## - A user-friendly AR dashboard that displays information about the wine and food pairing. 

## Steps: 
## 1) Collect information and data from winespectator.com and input it into an excel spreadsheet to create a CSV file. 
## 2) Using Vuforia, we will create an image target for the 3D food pairing model. 
## 3) Create the user interface with canvases to display information about the wine and food pairing. 
## 4) Add code allowing the app to pull specific information from the CSV file (about the type of wine being the user has searched) and present it through the user interface.
